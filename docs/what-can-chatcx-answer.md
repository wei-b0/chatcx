## **📢 How to Get the Best Responses**

🔹 **Be specific** → Instead of _"What’s happening in crypto?"_, ask _"What are the latest trends in DeFi?"_  
🔹 **Ask for sentiment analysis** → _"Are influencers bullish or bearish on Solana?"_  
🔹 **Use platform names** → _"What’s trending on Base and Arbitrum?"_  
🔹 **Avoid price predictions** → ChatCX doesn’t track live charts, only narratives, sentiments and keywords.
